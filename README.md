<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A compilation of Jupyter Notebook for understanding different concepts in geomechanics. Under construction mostly for my own understanding but with future teaching in mind.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
### Scripts contained
- estimate_nucleation_size.ipynb

Theoretical estimates of nucleation size considering the different solutions of Rice and Ruina (1983), Rubin and Ampuero (2005), and Chen and Lapusta (2009), compiled in Laspusta and Liu (2009). Includes option to test whether maximum model grid is sufficiently small to appropriately resolve nucleation. 

- energy_release_rate.ipynb

Analytical solutions for the energy release rate under different rupture models. Currently only contains the pulse model from Weng and Ampuero (2019) for a fault with L>>W.
