### Scripts contained
- estimate_nucleation_size.ipynb

Theoretical estimates of nucleation size considering the different solutions of Rice and Ruina (1983), Rubin and Ampuero (2005), and Chen and Lapusta (2009), compiled in Laspusta and Liu (2009). Includes option to test whether maximum model grid is sufficiently small to appropriately resolve nucleation.
